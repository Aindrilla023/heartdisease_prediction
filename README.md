# heartdisease_prediction
The objectives focus on enhancing cardiovascular disease prediction accuracy, thereby improving patient outcomes and facilitatingÂ timely interventions by using several machine learning algorithms and model.
we have used correlation matrix in methodology to select features and predict accuracy through different algorithms.
Then, in proposed Methodology we have used PCC and SNR for concentrating on best features then find the accuracy.
